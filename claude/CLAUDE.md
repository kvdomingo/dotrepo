## Commits

When asked to commit, in the absence of further instructions, simply commit everything in the current worktree, whether staged or unstaged. No side quests, no running tests, no fixes, no branching unless explicitly told to do so. If committing is blocked by a hook modifying file(s), simply try again. Stop only on miscellaneous hook failure or an infinite retry loop happens.

## Code Comments
- Default to no comment. Code shows *how*; comment only to carry *why* — a non-obvious constraint, deliberate deviation, gotcha, or workaround.
- Never narrate the code ("loop over users", "parse the body"), restate names/types/signatures, or mark block ends.
- Never narrate the change ("fixed X", "updated to Y", "as requested"). A comment must read correctly to someone seeing the file fresh who never saw the diff; change context belongs in the commit message.
- Delete by default. A comment that just restates a decision the code already reflects — "1 vCPU is deliberate", "right-sized from prod" — is dead weight even when it points to a doc: the doc is where anyone questioning it looks anyway. Keep inline only what a reader needs *at that line* and can't get from the code — a non-obvious invariant/constraint ("timeout must stay < interval — ALB rule") or a cross-file sync obligation ("keep in sync with the router's TGs").
- Comments must stand on their own with any link removed — encode the substance, never a pointer as a substitute for it. Banned: specs, section numbers, design docs — point-in-time artifacts that get superseded and rot ("spec §7" is the canonical case). Fine: a maintained doc/README at a stable path — and when the *why* is a system-level narrative ("why it's built this way"), extract it there as a *pure* extraction: not an inline block, and not a comment that merely points to the doc. What stays inline are the non-obvious local details, which reference the doc only when a reader genuinely needs it *at that line* — a pointer-only comment generally shouldn't exist at all. Tickets, Confluence, RFCs, permalinks stay fine as trailing breadcrumbs.
- Occam's razor on every comment you *keep*, not just the ones you delete. "Carries a real *why*" and "is worded minimally" are independent judgments — a genuine *why* can still be 3x too long, and "it's a real why" is not license to keep the wording verbatim. Keep only the one non-obvious fact a reader needs *at that line*, in the fewest words; cut the mechanism the code already shows, where a value is consumed downstream, the consequence-of-the-consequence, and justification-of-the-justification. A 5-line block almost never survives intact — suspect it on sight; the razored answer is sometimes zero.
- A one-line summary on a public function/endpoint is fine; inline restatement of a single clear line never is.
- TODOs are fine and don't need issue IDs — but a TODO is a marker, not a substitute for doing the work in scope.
